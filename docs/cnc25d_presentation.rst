Cnc25D Presentation
===================

Cnc25D is the contraction of "CNC" and "2.5D".

2.5D and cuboid assembly are good solutions for automated personal fabrication.
The Python package cnc25d proposes some generic functions and design examples related to those technologies.

- CNC (Computer Numerical Control) and 3D-printers let move from design files to the physical objects.
- 2.5D parts are objects that can be described as a pile of free 2D path linearly extruded along the third dimension.
- Cuboid assembly is any assembly emphasizing an orthogonal reference frame.
