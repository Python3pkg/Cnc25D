Python Package for 2.5D part design and cuboid assembly

The cnc25d package provides functions that helps designing physical objects in 2.5D. 3D assembly made out of 2.5D parts are a cost-effective solution for automated fabrication as 3-axes CNC, laser cutter and water jet cutting machine get cheaper.
This package uses the Python library of FreeCAD (http://www.freecadweb.org/). Therefore FreeCAD must be installed on your system to use the cnc25d package.
